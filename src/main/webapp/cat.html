      <h2>Food</h2>
      <p>When it comes to feeding your cat, it's important you understand what to give them, and how much food they should eat in a day. You don‚Äôt want your cat to gain too much weight, or not gain enough weight. So consider giving your cat food based on age, and activity. Kittens need to eat more so it might be best to feed them three or four times in a day. However as your kitten grows start feeding them less, to about once or twice a day. Cats should be fed a variety of food. You can feed your cat dry food, like kibble, it doesn‚Äôt hurt to switch it up to include some wet foods like from cans. You can also feed them fish, raw or cooked meats every once in a while, but not too much. Always check with a vet to ensure what you should feed your cat specifically.

      <h2>Playing with your cat</h2>
      <p>Some cats can be more playful than others and that is why it is important to always play with your pet around the house to dispense that energy and exercise. Most cats like to chase things around, that is why it is a good way to buy fake mice so your cat can hit it around the house and chase after it. It is also recommended to get involved and dangle the mouse around your cat to interest them and throw it for them to chase after it. Another way to involve your cat in play is if you have a stick with a feather at the end, dangle it around your cat to allow them to chase around it, just be careful your cat might be a high jumper and you might get in the crossfire. If you don‚Äôt mind getting a little risking you can also use your hands, but warning cats do have really fast reactions and you might get scratched. Accourse there are other ways to play with your cat but these are the most common way to mess with them and keep them on their feet.
